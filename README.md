# eidetic-api
Online file-system designed for graph-based—rather than hierarchical/tree-based—file organization and exploration. Group your ideas and navigate through them by the similarity of their contents measured by NLP AI. This uses [ColBERTv2](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) to generate embeddings for saved entries.
